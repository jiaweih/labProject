This Git repository stores some scripts written for the project Integrated Scenarios of the Future Western U.S. Environment, 
an effort to understand and predict the effects of climate change on the Western U.S.'s fish, wildlife, hydrology, and ecosystem 
services.

##Tools
[NCO][1]: The netCDF Operators (NCO) comprise a dozen standalone, command-line programs that take netCDF, HDF, and/or DAP files as 
input, then operate (e.g., derive new data, compute statistics, print, hyperslab, manipulate metadata) and output the results 
to screen or files in text, binary, or netCDF formats.

[CDO][2]: CDO (Climate Data Operators) is a collection of command line Operators to manipulate and analyse Climate and NWP model 
Data.

[Bash][3]: Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. 

[Python][4]: Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes 
code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
such as C++ or Java.

[IPython Notebook][5]: The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, 
text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document.

##Examples of IPython Notebooks
[Comparison of hydrological modeling results with inputs from different climate model simulations][6]

[Quality control of inputs to hydrological modeling][7]
